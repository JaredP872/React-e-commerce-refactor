# React-e-commerce-refactor

Overview
I created an e-commerce website that sells mobile devices to users. These devices vary between iPhone and Samsung models.

The website consists of three pages: the Home page, the Product page, and the Contact page. On the Home page, you will get a brief overview of what my website is about. On the Product page, you will be able to view the products offered in my e-commerce store, finally, on the Contact page, you may leave a comment or send us a message regarding any partnership opportunities or questions.
