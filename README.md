# React-e-commerce-refactor

Overview
I created an e-commerce website that sells mobile devices to users. These devices vary between iPhone and Samsung models.

The website consists of three pages: the Home page, the Product page, and the Contact page.
• On the Home page, you will get a brief overview of what my website is about.
• On the Product page, you will be able to view the products offered in my e-commerce store.
• Finally, on the Contact page, you may leave a comment or send us a message regarding any partnership opportunities or questions.

Steps to Set Up the Website

1. Clone the repository.

2. Open your local terminal and use the command:
   cd Desktop

3. Once you are in your Desktop directory, use the command:
   git clone (my repo url)

4. The repository is now in a folder on your desktop.

5. Open the folder in your preferred code editor.

6. The repository was created with Vite, so you need to install all dependencies by running:
   npm install in your code editor’s terminal.

7. To view the website locally, run:
   npm run dev

8. Copy the generated localhost link and paste it into your browser to view the e-commerce site.

This e-commerce website was created by CorpTechnologies in 2025.
